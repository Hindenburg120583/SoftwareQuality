Nicole:

My test code needed:
  Descriptive pass/fail messages
  Better protection against crashing from bad source code
  to allow NULL as a valid data type

I wish my code:
  Used JUnit
  Iterated through each Simple.java within a specified folder
  Was packaged in a way that was not IDE-dependent
